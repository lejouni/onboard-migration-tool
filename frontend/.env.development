# Development environment variables for local development (not in Docker)
# This file ensures the frontend can connect to the backend when running locally
# When running in Docker, this file is not used - the app uses relative URLs

# API URL for local development (backend running on port 8000)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# API timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000 = 30 seconds)
# Increase this value if you experience timeout errors during Legacy Cleanup scans
# Example: REACT_APP_API_TIMEOUT=60000 for 60 seconds
